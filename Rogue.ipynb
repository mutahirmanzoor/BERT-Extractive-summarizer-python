      "(CNN) -- A magnitude 6.7 earthquake rattled Papua New Guinea early Friday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake was centered about 200 miles north-northeast of Port Moresby and had a depth of 28 miles. No tsunami warning was issued, according to the Tsunami Warning Center. Papua New Guinea is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n",
